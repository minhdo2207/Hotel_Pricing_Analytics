# Hotel_Pricing_Analytics
Project Idea
When planning a vacation, accommodation expenses can be a significant portion of your budget. Hotel prices can vary widely depending on factors like location, room type, and time of booking. Our project aims to automate the process of tracking hotel prices on Booking.com, one of the world's leading hotel booking platforms.

How it works:
Data Collection: We scrape data from Booking.com, gathering information about various hotels, including their names, room types, locations, and prices.

Machine Learning: We employ machine learning algorithms to analyze and learn from this data. The model we develop will consider numerous features of hotels and use this information to predict their prices.

Price Prediction: Using the trained model, you can input specific details about a hotel, and the system will provide you with an estimated price, helping you make more informed decisions when booking your accommodation.
